# sonde-opener-tool

Tools(s) top open radiosondes.  Mechanical tools.

Locally, folks have been recovering NWS radiosondes.  Specifically,
[Vaisala RS41-SGP](https://www.vaisala.com/en/products/weather-environmental-sensors/upper-air-radiosondes-rs41) sondes.  (And reprogramming for a nearby
amateur radio band and re-flying them.)

These are held together with a couple of plastic clips.  Sure, these can be
pried open, but it seemed like an interesting design problem to come up with a
clip release tool.

The lower clip was easy, and works great as a 3D printed tool.  The clip
releases with a satisfying click.  Design can be found [HERE](lower).

The upper clip is more stout.  I have a 3D printed design that is marginal.
I'll try some modifications to see if a better release action is possible.  It
may be also that it needs to be fabricated from a tougher material than PLA.
