# upper-tools

A pair of tools for removing the upper clip from a Vaisala RS41-SGP radiosonde.

* TODO:  add stage 1 tool here
* [upper-stage-2-tool.pdf](upper-stage-2-tool.pdf)

## Instructions for use

1.  Press the pronged end of the stage 1 tool into the upper clip.  This will
    at least partially disengage the clip.

2.  If needed, press the pronged end of the stage 2 tool into the upper clip
    to disengage the clip entirely.

    Note:  the upper clip extends to the back wall of the rear clamshell.  Step
           1 works well enough holding in hand.  However, step 2 requires
           holding the front polystyrene clamshell so the upper clip can
           disengage fully.  It is easier than it sounds.

## Instructions for printing

I printed on a Prusa with PLA filament using a 0.2 mm layer height, 3 layer
(default 2) outer shell, and solid fill.  The tool isn't too fussy, so a
variety of printing options will likely work fine.  The default 2 layer outer
shell I'm sure would be fine as well.

## Design notes

Measurements were made from a sample RS41-SGP radiosonde.

A bit of sketching and designing with the dimensions was done on a piece of
paper.  Then the parts were designed in FreeCAD.
